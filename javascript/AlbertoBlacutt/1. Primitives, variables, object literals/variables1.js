// var has scope contrains what the developers has issues
// let introduced in ES6 and was introduced to mitigate issues posed by variables
// In short, let helps us by making it easier to see where variables live in our code.

//let do note let you redeclare a variable
// let dog = 'brian';
// let dog = 'Chimuelo'; //error
// console.log(dog);

// let dog = 'brian';
// let chimuelo = 'chimuelo'
// dog = chimuelo; //success
// console.log(dog);

//const is also limited to the scope which it operates. const is declared like var and let.
// Use const when you are sure a variable will not be redeclared.

// developer = 'pedro';   //error */

/*
  When declaring variables, it is good practice to avoid using var. Always lean towards let or const based on the following rules.

  Use let when we will be changing the value of the variable
  Use const when you are sure that variable won't change
  Using both let and const will keep our variables in the right scope and make our code easier to manage.
